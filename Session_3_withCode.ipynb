    "\n",
    "This is lesson `3` of 3 in the educational series on `finding word meaning in context`. This notebook is intended `to show how to find the collocates of any given target term—that is, the words that tend to occur near a word that interest you—and then how to find the distinctive collocates in particular`. \n",

    "So far, we've been working primarily with individual words and their counts and frequencies, without much attention to word _order_. Text miners sometimes call this a \"bag-of-words\" approach: Each text is treated as a collection of words, many of which occur more than once, but features like syntax, dependency, deixis, narratology, and context are ignored. There's nothing wrong with analyzing a text this way—for instance, we learned a lot about the words that distinguished our Beatles articles—but clearly there is plenty more to learn if we treat it less like a bag of words and more like, well, a text! \n",
    "\n",
    "In today's lesson, we take a few relatively simple steps to put word order back into the mix. We have already begun thinking about words in their contexts—for instance, in an article about Paul McCartney vs one about John Lennon—but now we will narrow our focus considerably, often to the level of a sentence or a phrase. As a result, we will likewise narrow our object of comparison. By finding collocates, the words that appear near any given target term, we will be able to identify the words that distinguish _words_. We know \"bass\" is distinctive of Paul and \"peace\" of John—but what distinguishes \"bass\" from \"peace\", or from everything else? We probably won't arrive at a final theory of word meaning 90 minutes from now, but hopefully we'll have some tools to help us think about it in new ways!"

    "1. <a id=\"1\"></a> Baroni, Bernardi and Zamparelli say that if the context is very large—e.g., entire documents—then analyses tend to capture \"topical\" relationships (like that between \"war\" and \"Afghanistan\"), whereas small contexts capture \"taxonomical\" relationships (like that between \"dog\" and \"hyena\") (251). They're discussing more complex methods of distance analysis than we're getting into here, but I still think that's an interesting example of the ways context size can affect our results, or even our sense of what \"meaning\" means.

    "Here we cash in on the methods we learned in session 2. The trick is to adapt our Fisher's Exact Test so that it can handle a comparison between collocates and the larger text, rather than between one text and some others. Let's work through what we need to build the table that we'll use in the test. We can start with the general principles we covered last time:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a = the number of times the word appeared in the corpus we're interested in\n",
    "* b = the number of times any other word appeared in that corpus\n",
    "* c = the number of times we would have expected the word to appear if it was evenly distributed across all our corpora\n",
    "* d = the number of times any other word would have appeared if the word we're examining had been appearing at its expected rate\n",
    "\n",
    "For collocates, this will translate to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a = the number of times the word appeared _within the window surrounding our target term_\n",
    "* b = the total number of collocates minus a\n",
    "* c = the number of times we would have expected the word to appear if it appeared _within the window surrounding our target term_ at the same rate as _within the text as a whole_\n",
    "* d = the total number of collocates minus c\n",
    "\n",
    "As with our Beatles example in session 2, the tricky part is figuring out __c__. We need to know the expected rate of occurrence for the word we're testing (let's call it __r__ again). If we want to know the significant collocates of \"estate\" within _Pride and Prejudice_, we can set that rate using the full novel. The important thing to remember is that we need the rate not for \"estate\", but for whatever collocate we want to test. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we want to see if \"derbyshire\" is a significant collocate for \"estate\" in _Pride and Prejudice_, even though it only appears 3 times in our KWIC. The word \"derbyshire\" appears 24 times in the novel, which is 121,567 words long. So our __r__ will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "r = 24 / 121567\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That comes to about 0.0002. Meanwhile the total number of collocates for \"estate\" is 400 (one easy way to get this is to sum the values of our collocate count dictionary). So that gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a = 3\n",
    "* b = 400 - 3\n",
    "* c = __r__ * 400\n",
    "* d = 400 - c\n",
    "\n",
    "Which comes to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a = 3\n",
    "* b = 397\n",
    "* c = 1\n",
    "* d = 399\n",
    "\n",
    "If we run our Fisher's Exact Test on this, we get a p-value of .62. So, even though Darcy's estate is in Derbyshire, the word \"derbyshire\" doesn't seem to be a significant collocate of \"estate\"!\n",
    "\n",
    "That's kind of a boring result, so let's pick a different target term, and build a method for finding all of the distinctive collocates!"

    "You may have noticed that we're not getting a _ton_ of results for any given target term. That's because we're dealing with a fairly small amount of text—we only collect text when we find our target term, and even then we might not collect _much_ text. This means that collocate analysis often gets more interesting as we scale up the amount of text we examine. In the context of this session, we don't want to go _too_ far with that, since large corpora require more labor (and processing time) to store, share, analyze, and interpret. But we can get a little bit of a sense by zooming out to Austen's entire corpus."
